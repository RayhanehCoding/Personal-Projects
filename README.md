## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This repository contains my personal projects in finance, quant, energy, and data analysis. 

My next project is working on estimating the financial risk of a portfolio of stocks. Using the Monte Carlo simulation technique and studying the correlation between different random variables associated with the portfolio and the market.
